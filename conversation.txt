One to three. What's the difference between Data Lake and Data Factory? Recommended.
A data lake is a storage repository that holds a large amount of raw, unprocessed data in its native format. It allows for easy storage and analysis of diverse data types, making it ideal for big data analytics. On the other hand, Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service for orchestrating and automating data integration workflows. It allows you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines to move and transform data across different sources and destinations. In summary, a data lake is for storing raw data, while Data Factory is for managing and transforming data between various sources and destinations.

How to scope.
To scope effectively, it is essential to clearly define the objectives, deliverables, and boundaries of a project. Breaking down tasks, setting realistic timelines, and identifying resources required, helps in establishing a clear scope. It involves understanding the project's purpose and limitations, while aligning with stakeholders' expectations and requirements. Additionally, effective scoping involves regular communication, monitoring progress, and making necessary adjustments to ensure successful project execution.
