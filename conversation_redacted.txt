A data lake is a storage repository that holds a large amount of raw, unprocessed data in its native format. It allows for easy storage and analysis of diverse data types, making it ideal for big data analytics. On the other hand, Azure [REDACTED] is a cloud-based [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]) service for orchestrating and automating data integration workflows. It allows you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines to move and transform data across different sources and destinations.
